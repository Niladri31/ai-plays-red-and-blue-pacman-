It uses Javascript canvas to draw the gui and animate the characters of pacman and ghost.

It uses best first search algorithm to compute the shortest distance between source and destination.

Best first Search algo was used both in ghost to catch pacman and pacman to go to a destination.

Best first Search is apllied as follows:
Given the source and destination from the source it will find the shortest distance from its neighbour to the 
goal node (also called as heuristics) . And will go in that direction.
If you want to track the location of pacman go to the console.
